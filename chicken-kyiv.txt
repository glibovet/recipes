Etymology[edit]
The dish has traditionally been considered Ukrainian in origin since its name comes from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. However, the Russian food historian William Pokhlebkin claimed that Chicken Kiev was invented in the St. Petersburg Merchants' Club in the early 20th century as Novo-Mikhailovsky cutlet, and was subsequently renamed Chicken Kiev (котлета по-киевски, kotleta po-kiyevski, lit. 'Kiev-style cutlet') by a Soviet restaurant.[1]

Alternative names[edit]
In Poland it is known as kotlet de volaille (pl. kotlet, cutlet, fr. de volaille, of poultry).

In popular culture[edit]
Chicken Kiev is the label used by William Safire for a speech made in Kiev in August 1991 by then U.S. President George H.W. Bush cautioning Ukrainians against "suicidal nationalism".[2][3]
Chicken Kiev, introduced in Britain in 1976, was Marks & Spencer's first ready-made meal.[4][5]
